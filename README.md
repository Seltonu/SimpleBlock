## Features

- **Simple Unlimited Ruleset:** Create rules to block or redirect specific websites or pages
- **Flexibility:** Block a single page, or block a whole site
- **Focus Mode:** Enable and disable rules on-demand for ultimate control over your browsing experience

## Installation

Install the extension from [Mozilla Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/simpleblock/)

##### Manual Installation / Development

Download and unzip the project, then type `about:debugging` in your address bar in Firefox. 
Under "This Firefox", find "Load Temporary Add-on" and load the `manifest.json` file.

## Usage

1. Click on the SimpleBlock icon (reccomended to pin to toolbar for easy access).

2. Add or modify rules in the popup window. Ex:

    - The following ruleset will block the <strong>homepage</strong> of Facebook, so you don't spend your time infinitely scrolling. <br> Still want to keep in touch with friends? Set it to redirect to your messages!
        ```plaintext
        Block: facebook.com
        Redirect: facebook.com/messages
        ```

    - Want to block a <strong>whole</strong> website? <br> Add the wildcard <strong>*</strong> at the end of your block rule so nothing gets through!
        ```plaintext
        Block: facebook.com*
        Redirect: youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
        ```

3. Your rules are saved automatically when you exit.

4. Need to concentrate? Toggle "enabled". Break time? Toggle it off!
